# Classification of Cifar10 Using Convolutional Neural Networks
 
In this project, classification was done on Cifar10 dataset using CNNs and hyperparmeters were tuned using validation set. One of the most well-known data used to measure the accuracy of classification algorithms is the Cifar10 data, which contains 60,000 images in 10 different classes.
